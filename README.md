# Getting-live-cricket-score-using-python

In this pyhton script, we can fetch live score of batsman.
I have scrapped espncricinfo.com for this purpose.
This code will only work with live cricket matches and will get the scores of batsman currently in the crease and will plot the bar graph according to it.
This code can further be modified into getting scores of matches that are finished.
